# Fast 2-Stage NMF

In the 2021 paper "A fast 2-stage algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization in streaming data" by Gu, Du, and Billinge, a new NMF method is proposed for online data.  See original paper at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08431.pdf.  This repository attempts to implement this method in Python.
